### Hi there 👋

Hello, my name is Andres Leon 
I am a computer science student 💻 at the University of Havana 🇨🇺.
My Passions are videogames 🎮, programming 🖥️ and photography 📷. 
My favorite language is Python 🐍, although I really like C# a lot 💙. 
I am a Linux enthusiast and a terminal fanatic.
The field of artificial intelligence awakens me a lot of interest, especially on the philosophical plane and I hope to work on it in the future.
